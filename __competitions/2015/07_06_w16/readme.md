###Questions
 - given an array of integers, you have to answer a lot of queries `find(a, b)`, which returns `even`
 or `odd` depending on the sum of absolute squares.
 - having `a`, `b`, `c`, find the sum of all numbers that can be created with maximum `4 a`, `5 b`, `6 c`
 - you have natural numbers from 1 to N. Below some of the numbers you can put an element which costs
 C it costs you S to increase the range of all the elements by 1. Find the position of the elements
 and the range they should be increased to cover all the numbers
